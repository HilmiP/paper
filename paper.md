# Introduction
In this work, bonding streghth EBC were examined after low velocity steam exposure.

Although there has been some pleminary studies to measure stregth using benidng method, no comprehensive study has been conducted (Richards, 2016). 

Lee et al (2021) identified the evolution of the interface characteristics upon steam exposure. Yet, it has been pointed out that further study required.

The main aim of the study the to understand effect of TGO formation upon steam exposure on failure of EBCs.
